# Fusing Sentinel-2 and Worldview imagery

This repository contains code related to the implementation of the 3 deep learning CNNs (Fusion-PNN-Siamese, Fusion-ResNet, Fusion-GAN) which were created in order to fuse Sentinel-2 (20 m) and Worldview images (4 m), as analyzed in the paper cited below.

## Steps to implement the code
Run:
>1. "training_preprocessing.py" to apply pre-processing to the training input and output files.
>
>2. "training.py" to train each model.
>
>3. "inference_preprocessing.py" to apply pre-processing to the inference input files.
>
>4. "inference.py" to create the fused image.
>
>5. "remove_01_scaling.py" to create uint16 values.
>
>6. "remove_histogram_clipping.py" to remove the histogram clipping effect.

*Detailed guidelines are included inside each script.*
